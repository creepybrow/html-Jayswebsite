    <h1>King Jay</h1>
    <p>There a loads of references to this. Some may find it offensive considering religious beliefs.<br/>
    It's just a joke between friends. Some may take it literally.I find it funny. And there are members.<br/>
There is an unwritten rule I do in which you are part of the knights of Jay. But you'll never know if your in it.<br/>
It's possible one day I'll post a picture of you with your name as part of a time when you inspire me to be better.</p>
